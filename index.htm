                    <p>
                        I am a 23 year old software developer based in western New York. It is my dream
                        to be a full-stack web developer and create web applications that make people's day to
                        day life easier in some way. I earned my B.S. in Software Engineering from the Rochester
                        Institute of Technology in pursuit of this dream and am always looking for new ways to build
                        my skills now that I've graduated. My current interests in front-end development are native
                        web apps and how we can better use HTML5 to create modern websites as opposed to more traditional
                        methods. On the server end, my current fascinations are in python and C# development, SQL databse 
                        design, and using smart tooling to create easy to manage DevOps pipelines.
                        <br><br>
                        I enjoy other hobbies and activities when I'm not working or developing in my free time.
                        I enjoy playing games on my Nintendo Switch (I've got a pretty mean Ness in Super Smash
                        Bros. Ultimate if I say so myself), reading books, going to the gym, volunteering, and practicing
                        martial arts. I also love going to concerts and often make trips into the city to see live shows.

                    <em>Why this site?</em><br><br>
                    I made this site mostly for the fun of it and to practice my skills, but it also will serve as a hub
                    to showcase projects I'm working on. It's pretty barren now, but once I get the site up I plan to
                    in the form of side projects. Check the Projects link in the navigation bar to see what I'm
                    up to!

                <p>
                    I believe it's valuable to have some insight on one's Philosophy in their career when working closely
                    with them. It can add valuable context to the decisions they make while working. That being said, my
                    Philosophy on software development is as follows:
                </p>
                <p>
                    It's my belief that software should be created for the betterment of mankind. Software development is
                    great, but it is morally wrong to create software for the purpose of harming others or helping yourself
                    at the expense of others.
